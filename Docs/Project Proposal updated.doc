The goal of this project is to create restaurant management system while ordering to best practices and avoiding the repetition of typical development errors.
All software engineering projects require project management and adhering to a project plan will be equally important.
Any business's primary goal is to maximize profit by improving productivity and reducing costs, without sacrificing customer happiness. One of the least effective methods now used by many restaurants to communicate between the restaurant and kitchen is a paper-based system. Although successful, lucrative restaurants use this strategy, there are a number of issues that could be perceived as decreasing the restaurant's efficiency:

Handwriting errors that lead to miscommunication.
•	Impossibly large order logging.
